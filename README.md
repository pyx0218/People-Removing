People-Removing
===============
When people taking photos, they often do not want walking pedestrian appear in their photos. Normally they will wait for few minutes, catching a chance when much less people walked by and quickly take a photo at that time. Our group wants to design an APP that takes about 10 photos consecutively in 3 seconds, detects people and removes people that user does not want them to appear in their photo.
